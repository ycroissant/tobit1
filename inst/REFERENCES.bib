abstract = {Abstract Practical considerations for choosing between Tobit, symmetrically censored least squares (SCLS) and censored least absolute deviations (CLAD) estimators are offered. Practical considerations deal with when a Hausman test is better than a conditional moment test for judging the severity of a misspecification, the need to bootstrap the sampling distributions of the Hausman tests, what to look for in a graphical examination of the residuals and the limited value of SCLS. The practical considerations are applied to a model of the intergenerational transmission of charitable giving using new data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). The paper shows how to use relative distribution methods to calculate CLAD-based marginal effects on the observable dependent variable.},

    abstract = { Categorical and limited dependent variable models are routinely estimated via maximum likelihood. It is well-known that the ML estimates of the parameters are inconsistent if the distribution or the skedastic component is misspecified. When conditional moment tests were first developed by Newey (1985) and Tauchen (1985), they appeared to offer a wide range of easy-to-compute specification tests for categorical and limited dependent variable models estimated by maximum likelihood. However, subsequent studies found that using the asymptotic critical values produced severe size distortions. This paper presents simulation evidence that the standard conditional moment test for normality after tobit estimation has essentially no size distortion and reasonable power when the critical values are obtained via a parametric bootstrap. }

abstract = {This paper provides a Monte Carlo examination of conditional moment tests for several forms of misspecification in Tobit and Probit models. The experimental design is based on actual data taken from a study of labor supply. Our results indicate that the tests work well, in terms of size and power, for the Tobit model whereas they perform poorly for the Probit model. The major conclusion is that although there is little to choose between the various forms of the tests the degree of censoring of the latent dependent variable is crucial.}

 abstract = {In this paper the standard cross-sectional static model of labor supply is modified to make the wage endogenous, and a joint wage-hours model is estimated. The econometric technique addresses the non-linearity of the budget constraint by approximating the constraint by a series of discrete points. The results show that the budget constraint is indeed nonlinear, that hours affect the wage quadratically, that true wage elasticities are lower as a result, and that the model fits the hours distribution much better than the standard Tobit model.},

 abstract = {Using the result that under the null hypothesis of no misspecification an asymptotically efficient estimator must have zero asymptotic covariance with its difference from a consistent but asymptotically inefficient estimator, specification tests are devised for a number of model specifications in econometrics. Local power is calculated for small departures from the null hypothesis. An instrumental variable test as well as tests for a time series cross section model and the simultaneous equation model are presented. An empirical model provides evidence that unobserved individual factors are present which are not orthogonal to the included right-hand-side variable in a common econometric specification of an individual wage equation.},
